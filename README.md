# Project Title

Paths is a game engine developed for choice-based and interactive storytelling. It allows users to create and play interactive stories where the narrative unfolds based on the choices made by the player. The engine provides a platform for developers to design engaging and immersive narratives with branching storylines and multiple endings.

## Description

Paths offers the following features:

- Choice-based Gameplay: Players make decisions at various points in the story, leading to different outcomes and branching paths.

- Interactive Storytelling: The engine enables developers to create captivating narratives with dynamic storytelling elements.

- Passages: Passages represent smaller sections or paragraphs of the story and are interconnected through links.

- Links: Links allow players to navigate between passages, creating a non-linear storyline.

- Actions: Actions represent future changes to the player's attributes, such as modifying their score, health, gold, or inventory.

- Goals: Goals define the desired conditions or outcomes that players aim to achieve in the game.

- Maven Integration: The project follows Maven conventions, allowing for easy dependency management, building, testing, and packaging.
